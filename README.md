# Combat-salvo

Combat salvo provides two low-resolution models: homogeneous and heterogenous salvo models based on the work published by CAPT Wayne P. Hughes. The homogenous model aggregates two forces to assess attrition via differential equations representing the offensive and defensive capabilities of each side. The heterogenous model accounts for multiple units in each force to provide understanding of the contribution of system or units to a greater force.  


# Project is a work in progress and not ready for use 

## Areas for contribution

### Homogenous Model

* DOE input support

+ Data output attributes

+ Data visualization of results 



### Heterogenous Model

* Unit Test

+ Dynamic targeting between iterations

+ DOE input support

+ Map visualization (Flask, leaflet map viz possibly) 

+ Output visualization

+ Defense matrix trouble shooting
